    When called inside a I{trial} process redirect Eliot log messages to
    Twisted's logging system, otherwise do nothing.

    This allows reading Eliot logs output by running unit tests with
    I{trial} in its normal log location: C{_trial_temp/test.log}.

    The way you use it is by calling it a module level in some module that will
    be loaded by trial, typically the top-level C{__init__.py} of your package.

    This function can usually be safely called in all programs since it will
    have no side-effects if used outside of trial. The only exception is you
    are redirecting Twisted logs to Eliot; you should make sure not call
    this function in that case so as to prevent infinite loops. In addition,
    calling the function multiple times has the same effect as calling it
    once.

    (This is not thread-safe at the moment, so in theory multiple threads
    calling this might result in multiple destinatios being added - see
    https://github.com/itamarst/eliot/issues/78).

    Currently this works by checking if C{sys.argv[0]} is called C{trial};
    the ideal mechanism would require
    https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/6939 to be fixed, but probably
    there are better solutions even without that -
    https://github.com/itamarst/eliot/issues/76 covers those.
